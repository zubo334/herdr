Herdr is a terminal workspace manager. It keeps real terminal processes running and adds structure around them.

## Workspace

A workspace is the top-level project container. Use one workspace per repo, task, or investigation.

A workspace owns tabs and panes. Its sidebar state rolls up from the agents inside it, so you can see which project needs attention.

## Tab

A tab is a layout inside a workspace. Use tabs to separate views like `agents`, `logs`, `server`, or `review`.

Tabs are addressable from the CLI and socket API.

## Pane

A pane is a real terminal. Herdr renders the terminal output, sends input back to the process, and preserves the pane across client detach.

Panes can be split right or down. They can be renamed manually, read from the CLI, sent input, and closed.

## Mouse UI

Herdr is mouse-native. You can click panes, tabs, workspaces, and agents. You can drag split borders, select text, and use right-click menus. Everything below is also reachable by mouse; keyboard bindings are an optional layer.

If you prefer keyboard-only control, or you want Herdr to stop capturing mouse input, disable mouse capture:

```toml
[ui]
mouse_capture = false
```

## Agent

An agent is a process Herdr recognizes inside a pane. Herdr detects agents from foreground processes, screen manifests, and optional integrations.

Agent states are:

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `blocked` | The agent needs input, approval, or a decision. |
| `working` | The agent is actively running. |
| `done` | The agent finished and you have not looked at it yet. |
| `idle` | The agent is finished or waiting and has been seen. |
| `unknown` | Herdr cannot confidently classify the state. |

Each client tracks which completions it has displayed. Viewing a completion in one client does not clear another client's Done badge. CLI/API statuses use the server's seen state, so they need not match a particular client's badge; both `idle` and `done` mean ready for input.

## Session

A session is a persistent Herdr server namespace. The default `herdr` command attaches to the default session.

Named sessions are separate runtime namespaces:

```bash
herdr session list
herdr session attach work
herdr session attach side-project
```

Use workspaces first. Use named sessions when you need completely separate panes, sockets, and persisted runtime state.

## Client and server

By default, Herdr runs as a background server plus one or more attached clients.

The server owns panes and process state. The client is the terminal UI attached to that server.

With one attached client, all tabs follow its size as before. With multiple clients, each can view its own workspace and tab. Different viewed tabs follow their respective clients; when clients view the same tab, the last one to focus, select, or interact with it controls that tab's pane sizes.

Detach the client with `ctrl+b q`. The server and agents continue running.

If you want to end the session and stop its panes, stop the server:

```bash
herdr server stop
```

## Modes

Herdr has terminal mode, prefix mode, and navigate mode.

Terminal mode sends keys to the focused pane. Prefix mode waits for one Herdr action after the prefix key. Navigate mode is the persistent workspace navigation surface.

Press the prefix key, default `ctrl+b`, then an action key such as `c` for a new tab or `w` for workspace navigation. See [Keyboard](/docs/keyboard/) if the prefix idea is new to you.
