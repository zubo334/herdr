Herdr detects supported agents automatically. Install official integrations when you want native agent session restore, direct lifecycle reports, or both. See [Agents](/docs/agents/) for the full status authority model.

## Install integrations

Open settings inside Herdr and use the integrations tab to install recommended integrations for agents found on your `PATH`, or run commands manually:

```bash
herdr integration install pi
herdr integration install omp
herdr integration install claude
herdr integration install codex
herdr integration install copilot
herdr integration install devin
herdr integration install droid
herdr integration install kimi
herdr integration install opencode
herdr integration install kilo
herdr integration install hermes
herdr integration install qodercli
herdr integration install qwen
herdr integration install cursor
herdr integration install mastracode
herdr integration install antigravity-cli
herdr integration install grok
```

## Uninstall integrations

```bash
herdr integration uninstall pi
herdr integration uninstall omp
herdr integration uninstall claude
herdr integration uninstall codex
herdr integration uninstall copilot
herdr integration uninstall devin
herdr integration uninstall droid
herdr integration uninstall kimi
herdr integration uninstall opencode
herdr integration uninstall kilo
herdr integration uninstall hermes
herdr integration uninstall qodercli
herdr integration uninstall qwen
herdr integration uninstall cursor
herdr integration uninstall mastracode
herdr integration uninstall antigravity-cli
herdr integration uninstall grok
```

## How Herdr uses integrations

Herdr uses integrations in two ways:

| Integration type | Agents | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Lifecycle authority | Pi, OMP, Kimi Code CLI, OpenCode, Kilo Code CLI, MastraCode | When installed and actively reporting for the pane, hook or plugin events author `idle`, `working`, and `blocked`. Herdr does not also use screen manifest fallback for that same lifecycle authority. |
| Session identity | Claude Code, Codex, GitHub Copilot CLI, Devin CLI, Droid, Qoder CLI, Qwen Code, Cursor Agent CLI, Hermes Agent, Antigravity CLI, Grok CLI | The integration reports native session references for restore. State still comes from Herdr's screen manifest detection. |

Custom integrations can also report state that is not visible in the native terminal UI. They do not need to be built into Herdr or use a recognized agent executable.

## Integrate your own agent

An agent running in a Herdr pane inherits `HERDR_ENV`, `HERDR_PANE_ID`, `HERDR_BIN_PATH`, and `HERDR_SOCKET_PATH`. If the agent exposes lifecycle hooks, use those hooks to report semantic state through Herdr's CLI:

```bash
"$HERDR_BIN_PATH" pane report-agent "$HERDR_PANE_ID" \
  --source custom:my-agent \
  --agent my-agent \
  --state working
```

Report `idle` when the agent is ready for input and `blocked` when it needs a user decision. Use `--message` to describe a block. When the agent exits, release the same source's lifecycle authority:

```bash
"$HERDR_BIN_PATH" pane release-agent "$HERDR_PANE_ID" \
  --source custom:my-agent \
  --agent my-agent
```

Report only when `HERDR_ENV=1` and the required variables are present. This keeps the integration a no-op outside Herdr. Keep `--source` stable and unique to the integration. If reports can arrive out of order, include a strictly increasing `--seq`; Herdr ignores stale sequence numbers from the same source.

You can include `--agent-session-id` or `--agent-session-path` with `report-agent`, or use `pane report-agent-session` when session identity changes independently of state. Herdr exposes that reference through its pane and agent APIs. Automatic session restore also requires Herdr to know how to launch that agent and resume the referenced session.

Use `HERDR_BIN_PATH` and the CLI wrappers for portable integrations. Code that needs direct IPC can send the equivalent `pane.report_agent`, `pane.report_agent_session`, and `pane.release_agent` requests described in the [Socket API](/docs/socket-api/#agent-state-reporting).

[Prime Agent's built-in Herdr reporter](https://github.com/PrimeIntellect-ai/prime-agent/blob/main/packages/coding-agent/src/core/extensions/builtin/herdr-agent-state.ts) is a real-world example. It activates only inside Herdr, maps agent events to `working`, `idle`, and `blocked`, preserves report ordering across sessions, and releases authority on exit.

Some integrations report native agent session references. Herdr uses official session references to resume Claude Code, Codex, Devin CLI, Droid, Kimi Code CLI, Qoder CLI, Qwen Code, Cursor Agent CLI, Grok CLI, GitHub Copilot CLI, Pi, OMP, Hermes Agent, OpenCode, Kilo Code CLI, MastraCode, and Antigravity CLI panes after a Herdr server restart unless `[session] resume_agents_on_restore = false` disables it.

Native session restore requires current Herdr integrations: Pi integration version `2`, OMP version `3`, Claude Code version `6`, Codex version `5`, GitHub Copilot CLI version `2`, Devin CLI version `2`, Droid version `2`, Kimi Code CLI version `3`, Qoder CLI version `2`, Qwen Code version `1`, Cursor Agent CLI version `1`, Grok CLI version `1`, OpenCode version `5`, Kilo Code CLI version `1`, Hermes Agent version `5`, MastraCode version `1`, or Antigravity CLI version `1`. Check installed versions with `herdr integration status`.

## Pi

Install the Pi integration:

```bash
herdr integration install pi
```

Herdr writes the bundled extension to:

```text
~/.pi/agent/extensions/herdr-agent-state.ts
```

If `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is set, Herdr writes to `$PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR/extensions/herdr-agent-state.ts` instead. Herdr creates the extensions directory when the Pi agent directory already exists. Uninstall removes only that extension file.

## OMP

Install the OMP integration:

```bash
herdr integration install omp
```

Herdr writes the bundled extension to:

```text
~/.omp/agent/extensions/herdr-omp-agent-state.ts
```

Herdr uses `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` as the complete agent directory when set. Otherwise, it uses `$HOME/$PI_CONFIG_DIR/agent` when `PI_CONFIG_DIR` is set, falling back to `~/.omp/agent`. If Pi and OMP resolve to the same extension directory, Herdr refuses the OMP install so the OMP extension cannot be loaded by Pi. Configure separate agent directories before installing both integrations. Herdr creates the extensions directory when the resolved OMP agent directory already exists. Uninstall removes only that extension file.

The OMP integration reports `omp` as the agent label, lifecycle state, and native session identity through Herdr's socket API. It does not require native process detection for the `omp` executable, and Herdr can resume an OMP pane with `omp --resume=<session>` after a server restart.

## Claude Code

Install the Claude Code hook:

```bash
herdr integration install claude
```

The hook reports Claude Code session identity to the local Herdr socket on session start. Claude Code state comes from Herdr's screen manifest detection.

Herdr uses `~/.claude` by default, or `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` when set. The Claude config directory must already exist. Install writes `hooks/herdr-agent-state.sh` and updates `settings.json` with Herdr hook entries. Uninstall removes the matching hook entries and deletes the hook script.

## Codex

Install the Codex hook:

```bash
herdr integration install codex
```

The Codex hook reports session identity through the same local socket API used by other integrations. Codex state comes from Herdr's screen manifest detection.

Herdr uses `~/.codex` by default, or `CODEX_HOME` when set. The Codex config directory must already exist. Install writes `herdr-agent-state.sh`, updates `hooks.json`, and ensures `[features] hooks = true` in `config.toml`. It also removes the deprecated top-level `codex_hooks` flag when present. Uninstall removes Herdr entries from `hooks.json` and deletes the hook script, but leaves `config.toml` unchanged.

## GitHub Copilot CLI

Install the GitHub Copilot CLI hook:

```bash
herdr integration install copilot
```

The Copilot hook reports session identity through the same local socket API used by other integrations. Copilot state comes from Herdr's screen manifest detection.

Herdr uses `~/.copilot` by default, or `COPILOT_HOME` when set. The Copilot config directory must already exist. Install writes `hooks/herdr-agent-state.sh` and updates `settings.json` with a `SessionStart` hook entry. Uninstall removes Herdr entries from `settings.json` and deletes the hook script.

After Copilot emits a session-bearing event, Herdr can use the reported session id to resume the pane with `copilot --resume=<id>`.

## Devin CLI

Install the Devin CLI hook:

```bash
herdr integration install devin
```

The hook reports native session identity from Devin session, prompt, tool-use, permission, and stop events. Devin state still comes from Herdr's screen manifest and OSC detection because Devin hooks do not emit a reliable state transition after every permission cancellation or user interrupt.

On Linux and macOS, Herdr uses `~/.config/devin` by default, or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/devin` when `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set. The Devin config directory must already exist. Install writes `herdr-agent-state.sh` and updates `config.json` with Herdr hook entries. The hook refreshes the session reference while Devin runs. Uninstall removes Herdr entries from `config.json` and deletes the hook script.

Devin integration installation is not currently supported on Windows. Devin stores its Windows config under `%APPDATA%\devin`, which Herdr does not yet resolve. Native process and screen detection still work without the hook.

Herdr resumes stored Devin sessions with `devin --resume <id>`. Native screen manifest detection remains the state authority whether or not the hook is installed.

## Kimi Code CLI

Install the Kimi Code CLI hook:

```bash
herdr integration install kimi
```

The hook reports Kimi session identity and lifecycle state to Herdr for native restore and authoritative `idle`, `working`, and `blocked` status. It requires Kimi Code CLI `0.14.0` or newer.

Herdr uses `~/.kimi-code` by default, or `KIMI_CODE_HOME` when set. The Kimi Code config directory must already exist. Install writes `hooks/herdr-agent-state.sh` and appends Herdr-managed `[[hooks]]` entries to `config.toml`. Uninstall removes the Herdr-managed config block and deletes the hook script.

Herdr resumes stored Kimi sessions with `kimi --session <id>`.

## Droid

Install the Droid hook:

```bash
herdr integration install droid
```

The Droid hook reports session identity through the same local socket API used by other integrations. Lifecycle state still comes from Herdr's screen manifest detection because Droid hooks do not cover every lifecycle transition.

Herdr uses `~/.factory` for Droid hooks. The Factory config directory must already exist. Install writes `hooks/herdr-agent-state.sh`, updates `settings.json` with a Herdr `SessionStart` hook entry, and removes older Herdr Droid hook entries from `hooks.json` if present. Uninstall removes Herdr entries from both config files and deletes the hook script.

After Droid emits a session start event, Herdr can use the reported session id to resume the pane with `droid --resume <id>`.

## OpenCode

Install the OpenCode plugin:

```bash
herdr integration install opencode
```

Herdr writes the plugin to `~/.config/opencode/plugins/herdr-agent-state.js`. The OpenCode config directory must already exist. Uninstall removes only that plugin file.

The plugin reports lifecycle state and session identity while OpenCode runs inside a Herdr pane. After OpenCode emits a session-bearing event, Herdr can use the reported session id to resume the pane with `opencode --session <id>`. Native screen manifest detection remains available when the plugin is not installed.

## Kilo Code CLI

Install the Kilo Code CLI plugin:

```bash
herdr integration install kilo
```

Herdr writes the plugin to `~/.config/kilo/plugin/herdr-agent-state.js`. The Kilo config directory must already exist. Uninstall removes only that plugin file.

The plugin reports lifecycle state and session identity while Kilo runs inside a Herdr pane. After Kilo emits a session-bearing event, Herdr can use the reported session id to resume the pane with `kilo --session <id>`. Native screen manifest detection remains available when the plugin is not installed.

## Hermes Agent

Install the Hermes Agent plugin:

```bash
herdr integration install hermes
```

Herdr writes `plugins/herdr-agent-state/` under the Hermes home directory and enables `herdr-agent-state` in its `config.yaml`. `HERMES_HOME` defaults to `~/.hermes` on Unix and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\hermes` on Windows. The Hermes config directory must already exist. Restart Hermes after installing so the plugin loads. Uninstall removes the plugin directory and removes `herdr-agent-state` from `plugins.enabled`.

The plugin reports the resumable session id while Hermes runs inside a Herdr pane. Herdr uses screen manifest detection for `working`, `idle`, and `blocked`, and can use the reported session id to resume the pane with `hermes --resume <id>`.

## Qoder CLI

Install the Qoder CLI hook:

```bash
herdr integration install qodercli
```

The hook reports Qoder CLI session identity to Herdr for native restore. Lifecycle state still comes from Herdr's screen manifest detection because Qoder hooks do not cover every lifecycle transition.

Herdr uses `~/.qoder` by default, or `QODER_CONFIG_DIR` when set. The Qoder config directory must already exist. Install writes `hooks/herdr-agent-state.sh` and updates `settings.json` with Herdr hook entries. Uninstall removes the matching hook entries and deletes the hook script.

Herdr resumes stored Qoder CLI sessions with `qodercli --resume <id>`.

Native screen manifest detection remains available when the hook is not installed.

## Qwen Code

Install the Qwen Code hook:

```bash
herdr integration install qwen
```

The `SessionStart` hook reports only Qwen Code's session identity for native restore. Lifecycle state remains under Herdr's screen manifest detection.

Herdr uses `~/.qwen` by default, or `QWEN_HOME` when set. The Qwen config directory must already exist. Install writes `hooks/herdr-agent-session.sh` (`hooks/herdr-agent-session.ps1` on Windows) and adds a Herdr entry to `settings.json`. Uninstall removes only the matching entry and managed script.

Herdr resumes stored Qwen Code sessions with `qwen --resume <id>`.

## Cursor Agent CLI

Install the Cursor Agent CLI hook:

```bash
herdr integration install cursor
```

The hook reports session identity through Cursor's `sessionStart` hook while Cursor Agent CLI runs inside a Herdr pane. Cursor state comes from Herdr's screen manifest detection.

Herdr uses `~/.cursor` by default, or `CURSOR_CONFIG_DIR` when set. The Cursor config directory must already exist. Install writes `herdr-agent-state.sh` (`herdr-agent-state.ps1` on Windows) and adds a Herdr `sessionStart` entry to `hooks.json`. Uninstall removes the matching hook entry and deletes the hook script.

After Cursor emits a session start event, Herdr can use the reported session id to resume the pane with `cursor-agent --resume <id>`. The `cursor-agent` command must be on `PATH` when Herdr restores the pane; Herdr does not launch the generic `agent` command.

## MastraCode

Install the MastraCode hook:

```bash
herdr integration install mastracode
```

The hook reports MastraCode lifecycle state and thread identity to Herdr for authoritative `idle`, `working`, and `blocked` status and native restore. MastraCode has no screen manifest fallback; state comes from the hook while MastraCode runs inside a Herdr pane.

Herdr uses `~/.mastracode`. Install writes `hooks/herdr-agent-state.sh` (`hooks/herdr-agent-state.ps1` on Windows) and adds Herdr command entries to `hooks.json`, creating the directory when missing. Uninstall removes the matching hook entries and deletes the hook script.

Herdr resumes stored MastraCode threads with `mastracode --thread <id>`.

## Antigravity CLI

Install the Antigravity CLI hook:

```bash
herdr integration install antigravity-cli
```

Herdr uses `~/.gemini/config/` by default, or `ANTIGRAVITY_CLI_CONFIG_DIR` when set. This is the directory Antigravity CLI reads global customizations from, and it must already exist. Install writes `hooks/herdr-agent-state.sh` (or `herdr-agent-state.ps1` on Windows) and adds a Herdr-owned `herdr` block to `hooks.json`. Antigravity CLI keys `hooks.json` by hook name, so install rewrites only that block and leaves other named hooks untouched. Uninstall removes the `herdr` block and deletes the hook script.

This session-only integration reports the pane's current conversation, but not agent state. Herdr keeps deriving working, idle, and blocked from what Antigravity CLI draws on screen.

The hook runs on `PreInvocation`, so Herdr learns the conversation once the first prompt is sent. From then on Herdr can resume the pane with `agy --conversation <id>` after a Herdr server restart.

## Grok CLI

Install the Grok CLI hook:

```bash
herdr integration install grok
```

The hook reports session identity through Grok's `SessionStart` hook while Grok CLI runs inside a Herdr pane. Grok state comes from Herdr's screen manifest detection.

Herdr uses `~/.grok` by default, or `GROK_HOME` when set. The Grok config directory must already exist. Grok merges every `hooks/*.json` file in that directory, so install writes a self-contained `hooks/herdr.json` with the Herdr `SessionStart` entry next to `hooks/herdr-agent-state.sh` (`hooks/herdr-agent-state.ps1` on Windows), and never edits other hook files. Uninstall removes exactly those two Herdr-owned files.

After Grok emits a session start event, Herdr can use the reported session id to resume the pane with `grok --resume <id>`.

## Custom status labels

Integrations report lifecycle state as semantic state only. For example, report an agent as `working` without adding display fields to the lifecycle report.

```bash
herdr pane report-agent w1:p1 \
  --source custom:docs \
  --agent docs-bot \
  --state working
```

User hooks that run next to a Herdr-managed integration should use metadata instead of `report-agent`. Metadata changes presentation without taking over the integration's `idle`, `working`, `blocked`, or session restore authority. `--agent` and `--applies-to-source` guard only presentation fields (`--title`, `--display-agent`, and `--state-label`). Token patches always apply; their reporter owns clearing or TTL refresh. `--display-agent` changes the visible name.

```bash
herdr pane report-metadata "$HERDR_PANE_ID" \
  --source user:claude-title \
  --agent claude \
  --title "Refactor auth middleware" \
  --display-agent "Claude: auth" \
  --token summary="refactor auth" \
  --state-label working="refactoring auth" \
  --ttl-ms 3600000
```

Tokens and state labels are visual-only. Waits, notifications, and workspace rollups still use the semantic state.

## Debug integration state

List known agents:

```bash
herdr agent list
```

Read a pane when you need to verify what Herdr can see:

```bash
herdr pane read w1:p1 --source recent --lines 50
```

If integration state looks wrong, first confirm the agent is running inside Herdr and that the relevant hook or plugin was installed for the same user account.
